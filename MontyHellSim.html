        <h4>How Does This Work?</h4>
        <p style="width: 50%;">at first it appears as though the probability is 50/50, there's two doors and one is a winning door and the other is a losing door, however, due to the fact that you are more likely to pick an incorrect door the first time, it is more likely for the alternative door to be a winner, this becomes very clear as you add more and more doors</p>
    <p style="font-size: x-small;">if you don't know what the Monty Hall problem is, google it idk</p>
